# Models for Configuration Management

**Audience:** Advanced

**Track:** Development & Coding

Drupal’s configuration management system is mature enough to support many styles of management beyond the default and each have significant implications for IT, content authors, and stakeholders. Which one is right for you?

In this session, we will start by covering the principles of enterprise configuration management in Drupal. Then, we’ll dig into several different models for configuration management, talking through specifics of implementation and pros and cons of each model.

Last, we’ll take a comprehensive look at the models in practice. We’ll look at the challenges of scaling, legal compliance, and permissions that many organizations face.

## Learning Objectives

Key takeaways:

* Understanding the options for configuration management beyond Drupal’s default
* How configuration management changes as the number of sites increase in a multisite installation
* Confidence you’ll be able to choose the right long term management strategy for your Drupal sites, regardless of whether is 1 site or 1,000 sites

## Target Audience

This session is for you if you architect new Drupal installations, are using or planning to use Acquia Site Factory or Drupal multi-site.

## Prerequisites

You should know how Drupal’s default configuration management works or have experience with multi-site. You will want to already be familiar with config split and config ignore, at least conceptually.
